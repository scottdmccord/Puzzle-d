Puzzled - Readme file

The Game:

Puzzled is a timed jigsaw puzzle game built with HTML, Javascript, and
jQuery. Users start the game by selecting a game difficulty level: easy,
medium, hard, or expert. Easy games have only 6 tiles on the board, and
the number of tiles progress with each increasing difficulty. After the
board has been assembled, the user clicks "Start Puzzle" and the tiles
will randomly shuffle around the board. Because this is a timed game,
the user will only get to see the complete image before he starts the
puzzle.

Once the board is generated and shuffed, the user can swap two tiles.
To swap tiles, a user clicks on the tile he wishes to move. Then the user clicks on
the position that he wishes to move the tile to. On the second click,
the first tile will switch positions with the tile under the second click.
When the puzzle is put back together, a notification alerts the user that
he has won the game. At the top of the page, a timer displays the time
it took the user to finish the puzzle. If the user wishes to play again,
he can click the "New Puzzle" button to start the game over again.

The landing page:

The landing page was modeled off of the website:
http://go.fivestars.com/fivestars-trial

There is a form with four fields, a username, first name, last name,
and favorite color. For now, only the username carries over to the
game page. Ideally, I want to have the first and last name, as well as
favorite color, displayed on leader boards when I get that working.

Technologies used:

The puzzle consists of a container div which holds several divs inside
of it, depending on the difficulty. I first created a function that
uses two for loops to create a nested array (two arrays, one inside
of the other). Inside of these arrays, I store the x and y coordinates
that my later "createBoard" function uses to slice up the puzzle
image into multiple divs.

Once the x and y coordinates are generated, I have another function that
also consists of two for loops to actually create the divs, add the
background image, and then set the the proper x and y coordinates (
generated from the previous function) so that the divs display their
proper piece of the image. These divs are then appended to the container.
Each div is also assigned a unique id, which helps to determine if
the user put the puzzle back together again (will be explained later).

To swap tiles, I used an if / else statement (if first click,
if second click) to swap background-position coordinates and
ids of the tile divs. Everytime two divs are swapped, a function
is run to check to see if all the divs are put in order again.

To determine if all tiles are put back properly, I used a for loop to
circle through all of the tile div's ids. If the div ids follow a
sequential order (ie. piece0, piece1, piece2, etc) the winning condition
is met.

Finally, I use a timer function so that the user can see how long it
takes to solve an individual puzzle.


Next steps:

Later this week, I would like to add a leaderboard feature, where
I can store high scores and everytime a user finishes a puzzle, if
their score is the highest, their username and highscore
will be displayed.

I also want to create a modul to replace the win alert.
